PwnedPwd stand for "Powned Password ?"

This script was written to share the ability to safely check if your password(s) have been leaked.

It was also written to add it to the scripts (bash, php and python) written by yrougy (https://github.com/yrougy/CheckPasswordLeak) with the same goal.

I autorise him to publish my script on his GitHub repository.

To use it, you will need to install a copy of curl.exe in the script directory
